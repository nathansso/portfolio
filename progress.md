# Progress Log

## 2026-04-26

### CLAUDE.md + progress.md initialization
- Created `CLAUDE.md` with development commands, CI/CD details, architecture overview, and workflow instructions
- Created `progress.md` (this file) to track all future changes

### GitHub repo sync script
- Created `scripts/sync-projects.js` — fetches all public repos for `nathansso`, updates descriptions from README content for projects with a `repo` field, and adds new repos not yet in the list
- Created `.env.example` with `GITHUB_TOKEN` placeholder; `.env` added to `.gitignore`
- Updated `package.json`: added `"type": "module"`, `npm run sync` script, and `dotenv` devDependency
- Added `"repo"` field to `datacycling` and `dsc207finalproject` entries in `lib/projects.json` so the sync script can link and update them
- Removed 3 lorem-ipsum placeholder entries from `lib/projects.json`
- Run with: `npm run sync` (requires `.env` with your token)
